# VideoBased-FaceMask-Detection

Face Mask Recognition System
This is a machine learning-based face mask recognition system that can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time. The system uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which has been trained on a large dataset of images of people wearing and not wearing face masks.

After successfully running the code, it will open up your webcam and start detecting faces. The system will then classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, and draw a bounding box around the face with a label indicating the result. If the person is wearing a face mask, the label will say "Mask", and if they are not, the label will say "No Mask"

Data
The dataset used to train the model was obtained from the Kaggle website, which includes a large collection of images of people wearing and not wearing face masks. The images were preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality in the training data.
